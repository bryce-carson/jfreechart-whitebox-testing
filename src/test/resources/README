HousePrices.csv was modified using sed to convert yes to 1 and no to 0
for use as boolean data in asgmt. three for COMP 4299.

HousePricesColumnSums was determined with Emacs Lisp for the first column:
(apply #'+ (number-sequence 1 546))
149331 (#o443523, #x24753)

HousePricesModified.csv is a modified version of HousePrices.csv wherein three
randomly chosen values were deleted to make NULL values in the CSV. It was later
discovered that this prevented the CSV reader of JFreeChart from reading the
CSV, so the class under test was never tested in this case. The modified data
file was deleted and no modifications to the HousePrices.csv file are made in
the final tests.
